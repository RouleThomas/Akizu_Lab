# Project

Simulation of Experimental and SBS signatures.

Previous version `004` got issues, notably with the dbNSFP, many score were missing: lets make things clean and corect the pos based simulation (see version4 in 009/004) + use the same GENCODE version as in the dbNSFP: **dbNSFP v5.3 with GENCODE release 49 (Ensembl release 115, September 2025)**
