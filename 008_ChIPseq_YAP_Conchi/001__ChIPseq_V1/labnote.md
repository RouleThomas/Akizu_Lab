# Overview

Collaboration with Estaras lab for ChIPseq analysis:
- NR2F2, YAP, EZH2, QSER1 in CPCs and hESCs (hESC-derived cardiac progenitors)


ChIPs and input sequenced separately:
- Chip in Basespace
- inputs in dropbox. [Inputs](https://www.dropbox.com/t/5CJhDwoT2KBPREhG) for CPCs (2 inputs; sample5 = CPC untreated (minus RA) and sample6 = RA treated (plus RA) --> NR2F2 and YAP) and hESCs. and [input](https://www.dropbox.com/t/qUo4hA4bsNk6bK8J) for hESC (untreated, under selfrenewal conditions)

Analysis:
- CPCs with and without RA; for NR2F2 and YAP.
- hESC no treatment; for XXX


- *NOTE: data downloaded in local from basespace/dropbox and then imported into the cluster*
- *NOTE: data is single end*


Objective:
- provide bigwig; is there peak


# Data renaming

Let's see all files we have and rename; and confirm with Conchi it is all good
