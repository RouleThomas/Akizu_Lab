# Overview

Collaboration with Estaras lab for ChIPseq analysis:
- NR2F2, YAP, EZH2, QSER1 in CPCs and hESCs (hESC-derived cardiac progenitors)


ChIPs and input sequenced separately:
- Chip in Basespace
- inputs in dropbox. [Inputs](https://www.dropbox.com/t/5CJhDwoT2KBPREhG) for CPCs (2 inputs; sample5 = CPC untreated (minus RA) and sample6 = RA treated (plus RA) --> NR2F2 and YAP) and hESCs. and [input](https://www.dropbox.com/t/qUo4hA4bsNk6bK8J) for hESC (untreated, under selfrenewal conditions)

Analysis:
- **CPC**: untreated vs treated with YAP1, TEAD4, NR2F2; with 1 input untreated and 1 input treated; (3 bio rep for all) --> *NOTE: 1 bio rep for YAP and TEAD4 are PE... All other files are SE, so I will treat them as everyon is PE using Read1*
- **hESC** WT vs YAPKO with EZH2, QSER1, DVL2; with 1 input for WT only; (2 bio rep for EZH2 and QSER1. 1 Bio rep for DVL2.)



- *NOTE: data downloaded in local from basespace/dropbox and then imported into the cluster*
- *NOTE: data is single end and paired end; so all treated as PE*


Objective:
- provide bigwig; is there peak


# Data renaming

Let's see all files we have and rename; and confirm with Conchi it is all good (file = `rename_008001.xlsx`)

--> The files from Basespace are easy to rename. The one from the rawData.zip need to be concatenated 1st...

## Basespace files
I created a tab separated file with current (`sample_name.txt`) / new file names (keeping the .fq.gz sufix) and then:

**make sure to convert the `rename_map.txt` into unix tab sep  format with `dos2unix`!!**

```bash
cd input_raw

while IFS=$'\t' read -r old_name new_name
do
    mv "$old_name" "$new_name"
done < rename_map.txt
```

--> All good 


## rawData files

--> Combine files from multiple lanes.
----> I add to manually rename CE10 as name was: `20979572019.gz`... WTF!! --> `CE9_S10_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`

Concatenate fastq discuss [here](https://www.biostars.org/p/317385/): `cat string_L001_sampleID_R1.fastq.gz string_L002_sampleID_R1.fastq.gz  > string_sampleID_R1.fastq.gz`.

--> Several of our samples dispatched in 4 lanes (`L001` to `L004`; **the concatenated are names `L14`; all unique are `L4`**)
----> input sample: `input_raw_Novogene/` output to `input/`

```bash
sbatch scripts/concatenate_CE56.sh # 17683162 ok
sbatch scripts/concatenate_CE78.sh # 17683171 ok
sbatch scripts/concatenate_CE910.sh # 17683182 ok

```

--> Only the Read1 file has been rename; like they were SE!



**make sure to convert the `rename_map2.txt` into unix tab sep  format with `dos2unix`!!**

```bash
cd input_raw

while IFS=$'\t' read -r old_name new_name
do
    mv "$old_name" "$new_name"
done < rename_map2.txt
```

--> All good 






# Fastp cleaning

```bash
sbatch scripts/fastp_CPC.sh # 17691945 xxx
sbatch scripts/fastp_hESC.sh # 17691956 xxx
```


# FastQC


**raw**
```bash
sbatch scripts/fastqc_CPC_raw.sh # 17691968 xxx
sbatch scripts/fastqc_hESC_raw.sh # 17691973 xxx
```


**Fastp-cleaned:**
```bash
sbatch --dependency=afterany:17691945 scripts/fastqc_CPC_fastp.sh # 17691992 xxx
sbatch --dependency=afterany:17691956 scripts/fastqc_hESC_fastp.sh # 17691996 xxx
```

--> XXX all good XXX 


# Mapping

Let's map with endtoend parameter as for `003__CutRun` (`--phred33 -q --no-unal --no-mixed --dovetail`)

```bash
conda activate bowtie2

sbatch --dependency=afterany:17691945 scripts/bowtie2_CPC.sh # 17692156 xxx
sbatch scripts/bowtie2_hESC.sh # 17692160 xxx


```

- *NOTE: I removed `--no-mixed --dovetail` and `-U` (instead of `-r`) for the fastq path as PE options* 

--> Looks good
