# Project

**H9 cell lines**
- PSC native:
    - WT: 3 Bio Rep (A1-3)
    - KO: 3 Bio Rep (A4-6)
    - KOEF1aEZH1: 3 Bio Rep (A7-9)


--> Directional mRNA library preparation (poly A enrichment),NovaSeq X Plus Series (PE150)




**Objectives:**
- Put together with CutRun







# Pipeline
- Download data (wget)
- **combine samples (from multiple lanes)**
- Rename files
- FastQC (fastqc)
- Trimming (fastp)
- Histone content (R)
- Mapping (bowtie2)
- Spike-in scaling (DiffBind)
- Bigwig generation (deepTools)
- peak calling (MACS2)
- peak assignment to gene (ChIPseeker)

--> Detail of the overall pipeline in `Meeting_20230919_draft.xlsx` 

# Download / import data


```bash
# Following email instructions
wget -r -b -c --user=X202SC24100552-Z01-F001 --password=f40sgxjy ftp://usftp21.novogene.com:21/
```

--> All good, files created in `usftp21.novogene.com/`


XXXY

# Rename file

Renamed manually as only 8 samples



```bash
cp input_raw_Novogene/*.gz input/
```

--> All good 



# Fastp cleaning

```bash
sbatch scripts/fastp.sh # 17775901 xxx
```
