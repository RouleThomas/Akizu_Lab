# Project

2 conditions, 2 genotypes, plenty of AB
- NPC; WT and KO; AB: EZH1 (2 AB cs and pt), EZH2, H3K27me1/3, SUZ12 and IGG --> Objective, check whether SUZ12 overlap with EZH1 solely? Or also EZH2? Does EZH2 expression/binding increase with EZH1 KO?
- PSC (ESC); KOsynEZH1 (KO EZH1 with synapse-specific EZH1-HA tag=negative control) and KOEF1aEZH1 (KO EZH1 with ef1a strong promoter EZH1-HA); AB: EZH1 (2 AB cs and pt), EZH2, H3K27me3, SUZ12 and IGG


**Objectives:**
- Check EZH1, EZH2, H3K27me3 overlapping and notably upon EZH1 KO
- Validate the EZH1 AB specificity (compare EZH1-tag with EZH1 AB)


# Pipeline
- Download data (wget)
- Rename files
- FastQC (fastqc)
- Trimming (fastp)
- Histone content (R)
- Mapping (bowtie2)
- Spike-in scaling (DiffBind)
- Bigwig generation (deepTools)
- peak calling (MACS2)
- peak assignment to gene (ChIPseeker)

# Download / import data

Go [there](http://data-deliver.novogene.com/login/X202SC23092052-Z01-F001) and enter credetnial: (check email Novogen)

I created a `nano url.txt` with all link and used `wget -i url.txt` to download them all (1 link per raw); then `mv input_raw_Novogene/*fq.gz input` .

# Rename file

I created a tab separated file with current / new file names (keeping the .fq.gz sufix) and then:

```bash
cd input

while IFS=$'\t' read -r old_name new_name
do
    mv "$old_name" "$new_name"
done < rename_map.txt
```

--> All good

# Fastp cleaning

```bash
sbatch scripts/fastp_1.sh # 6677035 ok
sbatch scripts/fastp_2.sh # 6677038 ok
sbatch scripts/fastp_3.sh # 6677039 ok
```


# FastQC

**Raw:**
```bash
sbatch scripts/fastqc_1.sh # 6677168 ok
sbatch scripts/fastqc_2.sh # 6677169 ok
sbatch scripts/fastqc_3.sh # 6677171 ok
```

--> all good

**Fastp-cleaned:**
```bash
sbatch --dependency=afterany:6677035 scripts/fastqc_fastp_1.sh # 6677362 ok
sbatch --dependency=afterany:6677038 scripts/fastqc_fastp_2.sh # 6677368 ok
sbatch --dependency=afterany:6677039 scripts/fastqc_fastp_3.sh # 6677369 ok
```

--> all good


# Mapping

Let's map with endtoend parameter as for `003__CutRun` (`--phred33 -q --no-unal --no-mixed --dovetail`)

```bash
conda activate bowtie2

sbatch scripts/bowtie2_1.sh # 6678343
sbatch scripts/bowtie2_2.sh # 6678369
sbatch scripts/bowtie2_3.sh # 6678383
```

## Quality control metrics
Quality control plot (total read before trimming/ total read after trimming/ uniquely aligned reads)

Collect nb of reads from the slurm bowtie2 jobs:
```bash
for file in slurm-6678343.out; do
    total_reads=$(grep "reads; of these" $file | awk '{print $1}')
    aligned_exactly_1_time=$(grep "aligned concordantly exactly 1 time" $file | awk '{print $1}')
    aligned_more_than_1_time=$(grep "aligned concordantly >1 times" $file | awk '{print $1}')
    echo -e "$total_reads\t$aligned_exactly_1_time\t$aligned_more_than_1_time"
done > output/bowtie2/alignment_counts_6678343.txt

for file in slurm-6678369.out; do
    total_reads=$(grep "reads; of these" $file | awk '{print $1}')
    aligned_exactly_1_time=$(grep "aligned concordantly exactly 1 time" $file | awk '{print $1}')
    aligned_more_than_1_time=$(grep "aligned concordantly >1 times" $file | awk '{print $1}')
    echo -e "$total_reads\t$aligned_exactly_1_time\t$aligned_more_than_1_time"
done > output/bowtie2/alignment_counts_6678369.txt

for file in slurm-6678383.out; do
    total_reads=$(grep "reads; of these" $file | awk '{print $1}')
    aligned_exactly_1_time=$(grep "aligned concordantly exactly 1 time" $file | awk '{print $1}')
    aligned_more_than_1_time=$(grep "aligned concordantly >1 times" $file | awk '{print $1}')
    echo -e "$total_reads\t$aligned_exactly_1_time\t$aligned_more_than_1_time"
done > output/bowtie2/alignment_counts_6678383.txt
```

Add these values to `/home/roulet/001_EZH1_project/006__CutRun_PSC_FA/samples_006.xlsx`\
Then in R; see `/home/roulet/001_EZH1_project/001_EZH1_project.R`.

--> Overall >XXX% input reads as been uniquely mapped to the genome
